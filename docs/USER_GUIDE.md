## Tips & Tricks

### Efficient Card Creation

- Use the continuous add dialog to quickly create multiple cards
- Copy and paste from other sources (spreadsheets, documents)
- Consider using the import feature for bulk card creation

### Organizing Large Collections

- Use descriptive deck names (e.g., "Spanish Verbs - Present Tense")
- Assign emoji icons to categories (e.g., 🇪🇸 for Spanish, 🔬 for Science)
- Use sorting to find decks quickly
- Archive old or seasonal decks to reduce clutter

### Effective Review Strategy

1. **Spaced Repetition**: Review decks regularly, not just once
2. **Honest Self-Assessment**: Be truthful when marking cards right/wrong
3. **Focus Sessions**: Review one deck at a time for better retention
4. **Regular Practice**: Short, daily sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones

### Backup Best Practices

- Export your decks regularly (weekly or monthly)
- Store backups in multiple locations (cloud storage, external drive)
- Before major changes, export your current state
- Test imports occasionally to ensure backups work

### Performance Tips

- Keep individual decks under 500 cards for optimal performance
- Delete unused cards rather than keeping empty decks
- Close and reopen the app if it becomes slow

### Sharing Decks

1. Export the deck you want to share
2. Send the JSON file via email, messaging, or cloud storage
3. The recipient imports it using the import feature
4. They can rename or modify the deck as needed

### Creating Custom Predefined Decks

1. Create and populate a deck with cards
2. Export it to get the JSON file
3. Share with others or keep as a template
4. Import when needed to create a new copy

## Troubleshooting

### Cards Not Showing

- Ensure you've added cards to the deck
- Check if the deck is archived (it won't appear in main view)
- Try sorting by different criteria

### Import Failed

- Verify the file is valid JSON
- Check that the file has a `.json` extension
- Ensure the JSON structure matches the required format
- Look for missing required fields (name, cards)

### Review Not Working

- Ensure the deck has at least one card
- Try closing and reopening the deck
- Check if the app has necessary permissions (screen wake lock on mobile)

### Theme Not Changing

- If using "System" theme, check your device's theme settings
- Try manually selecting Light or Dark
- Restart the app if the theme doesn't update

### Lost Data

- Check the archived decks view
- Look for export files in your usual save location
- If using system theme, data is stored locally and persists across sessions
